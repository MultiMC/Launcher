# MultiMC 0.6.12

After roughly one year of maintenance and development work by various contributors, we're just calling it a good time to release.

What got added since the last time? Quite a bit!

### Visible changes

- Added a CurseForge pack browser

- GH-3095: Added an FTB pack browser

  Temporarily, MultiMC ignores download failures for FTB packs (GH-3304). This is because the platform has consistency issues.

- GH-469: Added a Technic/Solder pack browser

- Fixed online saving in Classic versions

- GH-3131: Fixed not working with proxy ports greater than 32767.

- Skins (the part used for account icons) are now rendered with the overlay on.

- GH-3189: Updated nbt library - this makes `View Worlds` work properly again for newer versions of the game.

- MultiMC now shows world icons and allows resetting world icons in `View Worlds`.

- GH-3427: `View Worlds` now has a very simple `Datapacks` button - it just opens the system file browser.

- Added the option to not use OpenAL and/or GLFW libraries bundled with the game.

  This is interesting if you have ones that come with youre system and work better.

### Technical changes

- GH-3234: At build time, the meta URL can be changed.

- Removed some hacks previously required to get Forge working

  MultiMC no longer contains pack200 and the custom lzma format support used by Forge only.

- Some preparations have been done to allow downloading Java runtimes from Mojang - support for the Piston repository.

# Previous releases

## MultiMC 0.6.11

This adds Forge 1.13+ support using [ForgeWrapper](https://github.com/ZekerZhayard/ForgeWrapper) by ZekerZhayard.

#### New or changed features

- GH-2988: You can now import instances and curse modpacks from the command line with the `--import` option followed by either an URL or a local file path.

- GH-2544: MultiMC now supports downloading library files without including them on the Java classpath.

  This is done by adding them to the `mavenFiles` list instead of the `libraries` list.

  Such downloads are not deduplicated or version upgraded like libraries are.

  This enables ForgeWrapper to work - MultiMC downloads all the files, and ForgeWrapper runs the Forge installer during instance start when needed.

## MultiMC 0.6.8

This is mostly about removal of the 'curse URL' related features, because they were of low quality and generally unreliable.

There are some bug fixes included.

MultiMC also migrated to a new continuous deployment system, which makes everything that much smoother.

### New or changed features

- GH-852: Instance group expansion status now saves/loads as expected.

- The bees have invaded the launcher. We now have a bee icon.

- Translations have been overhauled, yet again...

    - We now have a [crowdin site](https://translate.multimc.org/) for all the translation work.

    - Translations are made based on the development version, and for the development version.

    - Many strings have been tweaked to make translating the application easier.

    - When selecting languages, European Portuguese is now displaying properly.

- Accessibility has been further improved - the main window reads as `MultiMC`, not a long string of nonsensical version numbers, when announced by a screen reader.

- Removed the unimplemented Technic page from instance creation dialog.

- GH-2859: Broken twitch URL import method was removed.

- GH-2819: Filter bar in mod lists now also works with descriptions and author lists.

- GH-2832: Version page now has buttons for opening the Minecraft and internal libraries folders of the instance.

- GH-2769: When copying an instance, there's now an option to keep or remove the total play time from the copy.

### Bugfixes

- GH-2880: Clicking the service status indicators now opens a valid site again, instead of going nowhere.

- GH-2853: When collapsing groups in instance view, the action no longer becomes 'sticky' and doesn't apply to items clicked afterwards.

- GH-2787: "Download All" button works again.

- When a component is customized, the launcher will not try to update it in an infinite loop when something else requires a different version.


## MultiMC 0.6.7

The previous release introduced some extra buttons that made the instance window way too big for some displays. This release is aimed at fixing that, along with other UI and performance improvements.

There are some accessibility fixes thrown in too.

### New or changed features

- Mod lists are now asynchronous and heavily threaded.

  Basically, both faster and more responsive.

  The changes necessary for this also pave the way for having other sources of mod metadata, and for adding more mod-related features support in general.

- Mod list printed in log has been improved.

  It now also shows disabled mods, and has prefix and suffix that shows if the mod is enabled, and if it is a folder.

- You can now enable and disable mods with the keyboard.

  Toggle with enter.

- Enabling and disabling mods no longer makes the list forget what was selected.

- GH-358: Switched all the dialog pages from using buttons in layouts to toolbars.

  Toolbar buttons are smaller, and the toolbars can overflow buttons into an overflow space. This allows requiring a lot less space for the windows.

  All of the relevant pages now also have context menus to offset the issues toolbars create when using screen readers.

- Main window instance list is now compatible with screen readers.

  If you have poor or no eyesight, this makes MultiMC usable.

- More instance pages are now visible when the instance is running.

  Mods, version and the like should now be visible, but most of the controls are disabled until the game closes.

- GH-2550, GH-2722, GH-2762: Mod list sorting is much improved.

  You can now sort mods by enabled status.

  Sorting by version actually looks at the versions as versions, not words.

  Sorting by name ignores 'The' prefixes in mod names. For example, 'The Betweenlands' will be sorted as 'Betweenlands'.

  Sorting cascades from 'Enabled' to 'Name' and then 'Version'. This means that if you sort 'Enabled', the enabled and disabled mods are still sorted
  by name and mods with the same name will be also sorted by version.

## MultiMC 0.6.6

This release is mostly the smaller things that have accumulated over time, along with a big change in linux packaging.

No 1.13+ Forge news yet. That's going to be a major overhaul of many of the internals of MultiMC.

### **IMPORTANT**

On linux, MultiMC no longer bundles the Qt libraries. This fixes many issues, but it might not run after the update unless you have the required libraries installed.

Make sure you have the following packages before you update:

- Arch: `qt5-base`
- Debian/Ubuntu: `qt5-default`
- CentOS/RHEL/Fedora: `qt5-qtbase-gui`
- Suse: `libqt5-qtbase`

MultiMC on linux is built with Qt 5.4 and older versions of Qt will not work.

This should be a massive improvement to system integration on linux and resolves GH-1784, GH-2605, GH-1979, GH-2271, GH-1992, GH-1816 and their many duplicates.

### New or changed features

- GH-2487: No is now the default button when deleting instances.

- It is now possible to launch with profilers in offline mode.

- Massively improved support for icon formats when importing and exporting instances.

  All of the formats MultiMC supports are now supported in exported instances too, instead of just PNG.

- Added the pocket fox icon.

  We still have the big one under the staircase. It's cute. Just hide your chickens.

- Global settings can be opened from instance settings where appropriate.

  Many people use the instance overrides where using the global settings would be more appropriate. Hopefully this makes it clearer that the instance settings are overrides for the global settings.

- Added direct Fabric loader support.

  Much overdue. It's good. Fabric mod metadata is also supported in the mod pages.

- MultiMC now recognizes the new `experimental` Minecraft versions.

  Go mess with the combat experiment. It's interesting.

- Added Twitch URL as an option to the Add Instance dialog.

  You can now drag the purple download buttons from CurseForge into MultiMC and get a modpack out of it. Much easier!

### Bugfixes

- Translation folder is now created sooner, making first launch translation fetch work again.

- GH-2716: MultiMC will no longer try to censor values shorter than 4 characters in logs.

  It was actually leaking information and destroying the logs instead of helping.

- GH-2551: Trim server name and IP before saving them.

- GH-2591: Fix multiple potential memory leaks and crashes related to destroying objects with Qt memory lifecycle model.

- `run.sh` on linux now passes all arguments to MultiMC.

- Adding a disabled mod duplicate now replaces the existing mod.

- GH-2592: Newly created instances are now selected again. This was a very old regression.

- GH-689: MultiMC no longer creates an imgur album for single screenshot uploads.

- GH-1813: `#` is now saved properly when used in instance notes.

- GH-2515: Deleting an instance externally while the delete dialog is open no longer leads to some other instance being deleted when you click OK.

- GH-2499: Proxy settings are applied immediately and no longer need an application restart.

- GH-1701: When downloading updates, the text now reflects the number of downloaded files better.

- Icon scaling issues on macOS should now be fixed.

## MultiMC 0.6.5

Finalizing the translation workflow improvements and adding fixes for sounds missing in old game versions.

### New or changed features

- UI for the language settings has been unified across the application

- GH-2209: Sounds in old (pre-1.6) versions should now work again

  The launcher now downloads the correct assets and reconstructs the `resources` folder inside instances. This mirrors the same fix implemented in vanilla.

  Also, a minor issue with the reconstruction being done twice per launch has been fixed.


## MultiMC 0.6.4

Update for a better translation workflow, and new FTB API location.

### New or changed features

- FTB API location has changed

  MultiMC now uses the new location and should keep working.

- Translations have been overhauled, again

  It is now possible to put the translation source `.po` files into the `translations` folder and see changes in MultiMC immediately.

  The new translation workflow is like this:
  * Get a `.po` file from here the [translations repository](https://github.com/MultiMC/MultiMC5-translate).
  * Alternatively, get the `template.pot` and start a new translation based on it.
  * Put it in the `translations` folder.
  * Edit it with [POEdit](https://poedit.net/).
  * See the changes in real time.
  * When done, post the changed files on discord, or github.

  When using a `.po` file, MultiMC logs which strings are missing from the translation on the currently displayed UI screen(s), and which one are marked as fuzzy. This should make it easy to determine what's important.

## MultiMC 0.6.3

This is a release mostly aimed at getting all the small changes and fixes out of the door.

### Potentially breaking changes

- Local libraries are only loaded from inside the instances now.

  Before, MultiMC allowed loading local libraries from the main `libraries` folder.
  This in turn allowed existence of instances which could not be transported from one installation of MultiMC to another.

  GH-2475: A bug that allowed the launch to continue with missing local libraries has also been fixed.

  Effectively, you will get errors from launching such instances. You can fix the errors by copying the libraries to the locations indicated in the error log.

### New or changed features

- FTB import now has support for third party modpack codes.

  Better late than never?

- Instance creation can now be interrupted / aborted.

- GH-2053: You can now inspect and change the `servers.dat` file from MultiMC.

- MultiMC now uses the https protocol for many more network requests.

- GH-2352: There is now a button to open the `.minecraft` folder inside the selected instance.

- GH-2232: MultiMC can now use `.gif` icons (not animated).

- GH-2101: Instance renaming is now done inline, in the actual instance list.

- GH-2452: When deleting a group, MultiMC asks for confirmation.

- GH-1552: PermGen is no longer shown when it's not appropriate (java 8 and up).

- GH-2144: When changing versions of a component like Forge, the current version is marked with `(installed)`.

- GH-2374: World list has been improved:

  - Alternating line background colors have been added.
  - The world game type is now shown in a column.

- GH-2384: When installing a mod, existing mod with the same file name will be replaced.

- The background cat sometimes wears a silly hat.

### Bugfixes

- GH-2252: Fixed odd drag and drop behaviour on Windows

  Drag and drop of URLs from a browser locked up the browser. This needs further fixes on macOS.

- Instance naming fixes:

  - GH-2355: Whitespace prefix or suffix is no longer allowed.
  - GH-2238: Newlines in instance names are no longer allowed either.

- GH-2412: MultiMC no longer leaves behind zombie processes after launch on linux.

- GH-2382: Version filter for the forge/liteloader version lists was not matching the whole version name.

- GH-2488: More issues with broken relative URL redirection in Qt have been fixed.

- Some memory leaks of downloaded data have been fixed.

- MultiMC now handles instance groups and instance group saving better.

  Long deleted groups no longer persist in the group list.

- GH-2467: Broken (and nonsensical) sorting indicators have been removed from the versions page header.

## MultiMC 0.6.2

### New or changed features

- MultiMC now has FTB integration:

  - Official and third-party modpacks work.
  - Codes for private modpacks are not implemented yet.

- Version lists now show release dates where available.

- New instance dialog:

  - It has been completely overhauled and now uses the same kind of paged dialog design as the rest of MultiMC.
  - Vanilla version list now has a filter for version types.
  - FTB integration gets a page here, along with zip import and vanilla.
  - Technic integration is a definite possibility in the future.
  - If there is a decent way to list Twitch modpacks, proper Twitch modpack integration is a possibility too.
  - There still is no modpack updating. Much more work is needed for that.

- Other Logs page:

  - Now has a search bar, just like the main log page.
  - GH-604: Uses the same font settings as the main log.

- Icon selection dialog now has a button for opening the icons folder.
- MultiMC now has a shinier, updated logo.
- GH-2150: Custom commands have been split from the java settings into a new page.

  The use of variables in custom commands is now better documented.
  The label shows that they need to be prefixed by `$`.

- Player name is no longer censored in logs.
- MultiMC now probes the system for the name of the linux distribution as part of analytics. This will be used to focus future packaging efforts.
- Secret cheat code has been added... What does it do?

### Bugfixes

- VisualVM integration now works when VisualVM is bundled inside the MultiMC folder (uses a relative path).
- When reinstalling a component, or changing a component version, the custom version is now removed first.
- GH-2134: Fix multiple issues with the skin upload:

  - When uploading a skin, the model selection now works correctly again.
  - When the new skin file is specified using the `file://` URL scheme, it will now work correctly.

- GH-2143: Mojang services status display now reflects the current set of services.
- GH-2154: MultiMC now ignores the `hidden` flag of instance folders and they should show up correctly.
- When migrating Legacy instances, custom `minecraft.jar` will be preserved.

## MultiMC 0.6.1

### New or changed features

- GH-2087: The version page now has a button that will download all the necessary files without launching the game.

### Bugfixes

- Several issues related to bad URLs returned by the Curse servers have been fixed.

  The Curse platform does not use valid URLs according to [RFC 3986, section 2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-2) by including spaces and UTF-8 characters without percent encoding them.
  MultiMC has been improved to handle these invalid URLs and report errors in case other invalid URLs are encountered.
  This affected pretty much all modpack imports. You may want to reimport them if you were affected by this.

- GH-1780, GH-2102, GH-2103: Multiple issues with the build system and packaging on linux have been fixed.

  - Installed libraries now no longer have `RPATH` set and have the correct file permissions when using the `lin-system` layout.
  - Installation using the `lin-bundle` layout has been fixed on platforms that use position independent code.
  - `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` and `DESTDIR` now behave as expected on linux platforms.

- MultiMC no longer logs the process environment and launch scripts to its log files.

- GH-2089: Mention of instance tracking has been removed from the deletion confirmation dialog.

- GH-2087: The obsolete 'revert to vanilla' logic that was previously applied to versions has been removed.

  This should remove some confusing situations that could happen while changing and manipulation instance versions.

- The temporary `Minecraft.jar` is now removed from the instance after it stops running.

- GH-2119: The main instance view scrollbar now correctly updates when the window is resized without changing the number of icons that can fit into it horizontally.

## MultiMC 0.6.0

### New or changed features

- Contact with Mojang, Forge and LiteLoader servers is no longer handled by MultiMC, but a metadata server. Instead of generating and storing the files at the point of installation, they are updated hourly on the server and can be fixed when something goes wrong.

  This goes along with some changes to the instance format and to the metadata format.

  Instead of including the metadata JSON files directly in the instances, the instances now contain a new `mmc-pack.json` file that specifies versions to be used.

  The metadata can be found at [v1.meta.multimc.org](https://v1.meta.multimc.org), the [meta.multimc.org](https://meta.multimc.org) endpoint that was used during development will be replaced by documentation.

  This should be a much more reliable solution going forward, because it allows fixing issues without releasing new versions of MultiMC or reinstalling Forge/LiteLoader/others.

- Tracking of FTB launcher instances has been replaced with direct import of Curse modpacks.

  You can import the modpack zip files from CurseForge and FTB:
  - Get the zip, for example from [here](https://www.feed-the-beast.com/projects/ftb-retro-ssp/files/2219693).
  - Drag & Drop it on top of the main window, or select it in the new instance dialog.
  - Let the magic happen.

  If you need help moving over your old instances or worlds from the FTB launcher, stop by in the MultiMC discord server.

  The Curse import functionality is there thanks to the work [@Dries007](https://twitter.com/driesk007) and [@NikkiAI](https://twitter.com/NikkyAI) have done on [CurseMeta](https://cursemeta.dries007.net/).

- GH-1314: MultiMC now allows replacing the main jar in an instance without having to mod the Mojang jars.

  This goes along with changing the wording of the jar mod button to make it clear that it adds files to the main Minecraft jar instead of installing mod files with the `.jar` extension.

- Because the current instance format can now handle replacing the main jar, Legacy format instances are no longer directly supported.

  Instead of launching, you will be prompted to convert them to the current instance format.
  If the automated process fails, stop by in the MultiMC discord server and ask for help.

- Main window UI has been changed for increased clarity.

  Many people had issues finding the settings and instead ended up using the per-instance overrides. The main toolbar now has labels and the per-instance overrides have been deemphasized by removing the direct path to them from the main window. In general, it should be easier to find the right settings menu without getting things completely wrong on the first try.

- GH-1997: MultiMC now supports Java 9.

  This does not mean that the current mod loaders and mods do, but you can run Vanilla Minecraft with Java 9 now.

  However, Java 9 will come up last in the lists when multiple versions are installed and its use is strongly discouraged.

- GH-2026: You can launch Minecraft 1.13 snapshots - and hopefully also 1.13 once it is released.

  The bare minimum of changes needed for 1.13 to launch has been done.

  This does not mean support for modded 1.13!

  It is not yet clear what it will even look like and what exactly will be needed for Forge to be able to install properly.

- Bundled Qt libraries have been updated to version 5.6.3 on macOS and Windows

  This means less issues with SSL encryption on macOS and better support for HiDPI/retina displays, along with many bug fixes.
  The workarounds for SSL problems on macOS have been removed thanks to this.

- Linux builds were moved to a newer version of Ubuntu (14.04)

  This means better support on newer distribution releases, and dropping support for older distributions.

- Bundled OpenSSL library on Windows no longer requires Visual Studio runtime libraries.

  This should avoid issues with missing runtime libraries.

- GH-1855: The instance window now has an offline launch button.

- GH-1886: UI now clarifies that MultiMC proxy settings do not apply to the game.

- It is now possible to package MultiMC on linux without hacks.

  The build system has a concept of 'install layouts'. Example Arch linux package that uses this (multimc-git) is [available in the AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/multimc-git).

- Wrapper commands now support arguments.

  Previously, they would be treated as a single command -- spaces and all.

- UI elements that set maximum JVM memory are now limited to the amount of system memory present.

  Before, they were hardcoded.



  This is to accommodate the needs of some new mods for ancient Minecraft versions that do not work well with the applet wrapper.

- On instance launch, the used GPU and graphics driver are reported - but only on linux.

  Other platforms will hopefully get this in the future.

- There are some under the hood improvements for ancient Minecraft versions and versions not provided by Mojang.

    - The `haspaid` parameter is set for the applet wrapper.
    - MultiMC will prefer to use `.minecraft` instead of `minecraft` folder inside the instances now.
    - There is some preliminary support for classic multiplayer - see [this workflowy list](https://workflowy.com/s/2EyDMcp7CU#/1cbfc198cf28) for details.
    - A new `noapplet` trait has been added to allow running legacy Minecraft versions without the applet wrapper.

- Mods without changed metadata (Example Mod) are now listed under their filename instead.

- Tweaker list in metadata now overrides the order of already present tweakers.

  This allows running [Vivecraft](http://www.vivecraft.org/). Official support will hopefully follow.

- Instance icons can now be in the SVG format. Also, aspect ratio of SVG icons is now preserved in the instance toolbar.

- GH-1082: It is now possible to disable and enable version components (packages) similarly to mods.

- A new material design / flat icon theme has been added.

- When changing instance component versions, the present version is selected first.

### Bugfixes

- paste.ee upload now works again.

  MultiMC now uses its new API. If you used a custom API key before, you will need to generate a new one.

- GH-1873, GH-1873, GH-1875 : The main window can now be closed regardless of running instances and running instances directly will not create a main window.

- GH-1854: MultiMC should no longer crash when the instance is closed while the kill confirmation dialog is open.

- GH-1956: Launch will abort sooner when important files are missing.

- GH-1874: Instance launching and updating MultiMC are now mutually exclusive.

  It was possible to do both at the same time, with undefined results.

- GH-1864: imgur album creation now works again.

- GH-1876: Various included libraries have been changed to satisfy their license terms.

  Namely:
  - pack200 (GPL with classpath exception, now a shared library)
  - iconfix (LGPL, now a shared library)
  - quazip (LGPL, now a shared library)
  - ColumnResizer (replaced with a BSD-3 version).

- GH-1882: Update dialog will now save its location and size.

- GH-1885: MultiMC will now correctly download zero-byte files.

  No content does not equal no file and a presence of a file can mean the difference between something working or not.

- When importing modpacks, file permissions from the pack archive will no longer be preserved.

  The archives are sometimes broken and have invalid permissions, especially when coming from sources other than MultiMC.

- Instance export filter has been fixed.

  The filtering logic was picking and ignoring incorrect files under some conditions. Also, hidden files were ignored.

- Download progress bars are now less jumpy.

  Instead of tracking the total size of all downloads, each download gets a fixed share of the progress bar.
  In many cases, the size of files is unknown before a download starts. The change means that the total progress bar size cannot increase as new downloads start and file sizes are discovered.

- GH-1927: fix crash bugs related to FML library downloads succeeding multiple times.

- Rare problems with error 201 during Mojang authentication have been fixed.

- GH-1971: MultiMC will now no longer check path prefixes when importing instances.

  This has caused more issues than it solved. Now it will simply try to move the files instead of giving up early.

- Instance import and creation have been overhauled in general for increased reliability.

- Hardcoded link colors in various dialogs and dialog pages have been fixed and now should follow theme palettes.

- GH-1993: Minimum and maximum JVM memory settings will now get swapped if set the wrong way.

  The values self-correct on both settings save and load now.

- GH-2050: Fixed behavior of cancel buttons when browsing for paths.

  This affected various settings dialogs and pages, setting the paths to an invalid value when the dialogs were closed with the `Cancel` button.

- The checkboxes in the accounts settings page now have the correct appearance.

- MultiMC responds to account manipulation better.

    - Setting and resetting default account will update the account list properly.
    - Removing the active account will now also reset it (previously, it would 'stay around').
    - The accounts model is no longer reset by every action.

- When closing and reopening the instance window, the log settings are preserved.

- In the instance export dialog, the sorting order has been changed to go from `a` to `z`, not backwards.

## MultiMC 0.5.1

### Improvements

- Log uploads now use HTTPS because the [paste.ee](https://paste.ee) site is switching to HTTPS only.

- Console now has the line limit and overflow settings properly set when hidden.

  Before, if you didn't have the console set to show up on launch, it would have some low default values set.
  This meant that you wouldn't get enough of the log when the game crashed.

- GH-1802: Log resize is now handled properly.

  The log could end up with many empty lines because the wrong maximum size was used during the resize, potentially losing some lines.

- GH-1807: Fixed 'loggging' typo in console overflow notification.

- GH-1801: Launch script is no longer dumped into MultiMC's log on instance launch.

- GH-1065: Use of 'folder' and 'directory' in the UI has been unified to 'folder'.

- GH-1788: A problem with missing translation templates in the setup wizard pages has been fixed.

  It should be possible to translate everything again.

- GH-1789: Deletion of custom icon has been fixed.

  It wasn't possible to do it from the MultiMC icon selection dialog.

- GH-1790: While using the system theme on macOS, dialogs had wrong colors.

  The wrong colors are now only visible immediately after changing the theme to 'System'. An application restart will fix the colors.

  The underlying issue cannot be easily fixed.

  Upstream bug: https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-58268

- GH-1793: The Java wizard page did not show up as expected when moving MultiMC between different computers.

  The page should now show up as expected.

- GH-1794: Copied FTB instances did not work properly.

  The instance type of the copy was not set, causing it to not be usable.

## MultiMC 0.5.0

### New or changed features

- GH-338, GH-513, GH-700: Edit instance dialog and Console window have been unified

  The resulting instance window can be closed or reopened at any point, it does not matter if the instance is running or not. The list of available pages in the instance window changes with instance state.

  Multiple instances can now run from the same MultiMC - It's even more **multi** now.

  On launch, the main window is kept open and running instances are marked with a badge. Opening the instance window is no longer the default action. Second activation of a running instance opens the instance window.

  MultiMC can be entirely closed, keeping Minecraft instances running. However, if you close MultiMC, play time tracking, logging and crash reporting will not work.

  Accounts which are in use are marked as such. If you plan to run multiple instances with multiple accounts, it is advisable to not set a default account to make it ask which one to use on launch.

- It is no longer possible to run multiple copies of MultiMC from a single folder

  This generally caused strange configuration and Mojang login issues because the running MultiMC copies did not know about each other.

  With the ability to launch multiple instances with different accounts, it is no longer needed.

  Trying to run a second copy will focus the existing window. If MultiMC was started without a main window, a new main window will be opened. If the second copy is launching an instance from the command line, it will launch in the first copy instead.

  This feature is also used for better checking of correct update completion (GH-1726). It should no longer be possible for MultiMC to end up in a state when it is unable to start - the old version checks that the new one can start and respond to liveness checks by writing a file.

- GH-903: MultiMC now supports theming

  By default, it comes with a Dark, Bright, System (the old default) and Custom theme.

  The Custom theme can change all of the colors, change the Qt widget theme and style the whole UI with CSS rules.
  Files you can customize are created in `themes/custom/`. The CSS theming is similar to what TeamSpeak uses.

  Ultimately, this is a start, not a final solution. If you are interested in making custom themes and would like to shape the direction this takes in the future, ask on Discord. :)

- Translations have been overhauled

  You no longer need to restart MultiMC to change its active translation. MultiMC also asks which translation to use on the first start.

  There is a lot that has to be done with translations, but at least now it should be easier to work with them and use them.

- MultiMC now includes Google Analytics

  The purpose of this is to determine where to focus future effort. Generally, only basic technical information is collected:

  - OS name, version, and architecture
  - Java version, architecture and memory settings
  - MultiMC version
  - System RAM size

  It does not activate until you agree with it. It may be expanded upon later, in which case you will be asked to agree again.

- Java selection on start has been replaced with a more robust solution

  You can select from the list as before, but also provide your own Java and set the basic memory sizes - Heap and PermGen (for java < 8).

  It is checking the configuration and selected Java on the fly and provides more or less instant feedback.

- Java detection has been improved

  MultiMC will prefer looking for `javaw.exe` on Windows and now can scan most, if not all the usual Linux java paths.

- Java memory settings now allow running with less memory

  The minimum has been changed to 128 MB.

- There is now an initial setup wizard

  So far, it is used for selecting the translation to use, the analytics agreement and initial Java setup.

- Existing MCEdit integration has been replaced by the Worlds page in the Instance/Console window

  It supports renaming, copying, and deleting worlds, opening them in MCEdit and copying the world seed without the need to launch Minecraft.

  The Linux version of MCEdit is now also started from the shell script, fixing some compatibility issues.

- GH-767: Minecraft skin upload

  The `Upload Skin` button is located on the Accounts page.

- It is now possible to turn off line wrapping in the Minecraft log
- Groups now have a proper context menu

  You can delete groups and create instances in them using the context menu. Just right click anywhere inside a group that's not an instance.

- Exporting of tracked FTB instances has been disabled

  It did not produce viable instances.

- Added support for Liteloader snapshots

  Requested many times, it's finally available.

- GH-1635, GH-1273, GH-589, GH-842, GH-901, GH-1117: Mod lists have been improved heavily

  - There is filter bar to allow finding mods in large packs quickly.
  - Extended selection is allowed (does not have to be continuous).
  - You can enable and disable many mods at the same time.
  - Sorting by clicking on the column headers is now possible.
  - Mod lists have a column for when a mod was changed last time (or added using the mod list).
  - You can open the `config` folder from the mods list now.

- GH-352: It is now possible to cancel an instance update.

- Instance launch button now has a drop-down arrow instead of click and hold.

  This should make launching with profilers more discoverable.

- When instances do not exit properly (crash), they get a badge

  This should make it easier to spot what crashed if you have multiple running.

- Instances can now contain libraries

  Any libraries stored in `$instanceroot/libraries/` will override the libraries from MultiMC's global folders, as long as they are marked `local` in the JSON patch.

  This should make installing library-based mods easier in the future, and allow to include them in modpacks.

### Improvements

- GH-1433: The account selection dialog no longer shows e-mail addresses when no default account is selected.

  Instead, it shows Minecraft profile names.

- GH-1643: The preferred language property is no longer being censored in logs.

  Because the values are often very short (`en` for example), it was simply not usable.

- GH-1521: JSON editor now works when customized.

- GH-1560: Leading whitespace is now removed from instance names on creation and renaming

  Leading and trailing spaces in names can confuse Windows Explorer and Java.

- GH-1586: MultiMC now prints to command line on Windows, so you can review the command line options.

- GH-1699: Linux builds no longer contain the XCB library

  This caused many compatibility issues on with certain Linux graphics drivers and prevented MultiMC from starting.

- GH-1731: it was possible for the Screenshots page to show a list of all system drives.

  Trying to delete said system drives obviously lead to data loss. Additional checks have been added to prevent this from happening.

- GH-1670: "Instance update failed because: Too soon! Let the LWJGL list load :)." has been fixed.

  This fixes launching of legacy (and legacy FTB) instances.

- GH-1778: Jar modded Minecraft.jar location breaks mod assumptions

  Some ancient mods require the modded `Minecraft.jar` to be in `.minecraft/bin`, inside the instance. Now it is placed there.

### Internals

- Full support for the current Mojang downloads JSON format.

  This includes checksum verification, when available.

- Minecraft logging has been overhauled

  The log now persists after the instance/console window is closed.

- GH-575: Mod lists got a refactor

  The original issue is about adding sub-folder listings to mod lists. However, this is simply a refactor that separates the old Jar mod list from the less complex Loader mods. It allowed all of the mod list improvements to happen.

- The network code has been heavily reworked

  Most issues related to slow networks and failing downloads should be a thing of the past.
  This also includes post-download validation of the download - like using SHA1 checksums.

- Minecraft launching has been reworked

  It is now a lot of tiny reusable tasks that chain together.

  MultiMC now also has a separate launch method that works more like the Mojang launcher (not using a launcher part, but running Java directly).

## MultiMC 0.4.11

This release contains mainly a workaround for Minecraft 1.9 support and returned support for OSX 10.7.

### **IMPORTANT**

- GH-1410: MultiMC crashes on launch on OSX 10.7

  MultiMC didn't work on OSX 10.7 because of an oversight in the build server setup. This has been fixed.

- GH-1453: Minecraft 1.9 snapshots didn't download and launch properly

  This has been caused by a change on Mojang servers - the data is now stored in a different location and the files describing the releases have a different format. The required changes on MultiMC side aren't complete yet, but it's enough to get snapshots working.

  Full support for the new version file format will come in the next release.

- MultiMC version file format was simplified

  Some undocumented and unused features were removed from the format. Mostly version patches that removed libraries, advanced library application, and merging rules, and things of similar nature. If you used them, you used an undocumented feature that is impossible to reach from the UI.

### Improvements

- GH-1502: When the locally cached Minecraft version was deleted, the instance that needed it would have to be started twice

  This was caused by generating the list of launch instructions before the update. It is now fixed.

- Version file issues are now reported in the instance's `Version` page.

  This doesn't apply to every possible issue yet and will be expanded upon in the next release.

## MultiMC 0.4.10

Second hotfix for issues with wifi connections.

### **IMPORTANT**

- GH-1422: Huge ping spikes while using MultiMC

  Another day, another fix. The bearer plugins added in 0.4.9 didn't really help and we ran into more bugs.

  This time, the presence of the network bearer plugins caused a lot of network lag for people on wifi connections.

  Because this wasn't a problem on the previous version of Qt MultiMC used (5.4.2), I ended up reverting to that. This is a temporary solution until the Qt framework can be rebuilt and retested for every platform without this broken feature.

  The upstream bug is [QTBUG-40332](https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-40332) and despite being closed, it is far from fixed.

Because of the reverted Qt version, OSX 10.7 *might* work again. If it does, please do tell, it would help with figuring out what went wrong there :)


## MultiMC 0.4.9

Hotfix for issues with wifi connections.

### **IMPORTANT**

- GH-1408: MultiMC 0.4.8 doesn't work on wireless connections.

  This is especially the case on Windows. If you already updated to 0.4.8, you will need to do a manual update, or use a wired connection to do the update.

  The issue was caused by a change in the underlying framework (Qt), and MultiMC not including the network bearer plugins. This made it think that the connection is always down and not try to contact any servers because of that.

  The upstream bug is [QTBUG-49267](https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-49267).

- GH-1410: MultiMC crashes on launch on OS X 10.7.5

  OSX 10.7.x is no longer supported by Apple and I do not have a system to test and fix this.

  So, this is likely **NOT** going to be fixed - please update your OS if you are still running 10.7.

### Improvements

- GH-1362: When uploading or copying the Minecraft log, the action is logged, including a full timestamp.

## MultiMC 0.4.8

Fluffy and functional!

### **IMPORTANT**

- GH-1402: MultiMC will keep its binary filename after an update if you rename it.

  Note that this doesn't happen with this (0.4.8) update yet, because the old update method is still used.

  If you renamed `MultiMC.exe` for any reason, you will have to manually remove the renamed file after the update and rename the new `MultiMC.exe`.

  Future updates should no longer have this issue.


### New features

- GH-1047, GH-1233: MultiMC now includes basic Minecraft world management.

  This is a new page in the console/edit instance window.

  You can:
  - Copy worlds
  - Delete worlds
  - Copy the world seed value
  - Run MCEdit - the MCEdit feature has been moved here.

- GH-1217: MultiMC now tracks instance play time and displays it when the instance is selected.

- New buttons on the top toolbar:
  - GH-1238: button for the [MultiMC subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/MultiMC/).
  - GH-1397: button for joining the [MultiMC discord voice/chat server](https://discord.gg/0k2zsXGNHs0fE4Wm).

    Both are there for you to interact with other MultiMC users and us.

- GH-253, GH-1300: MultiMC can now be started with the `-l "Instance ID"` parameter, launching the specified instance directly.

### Improvements

- Instance list
  - GH-1121: Instances are now selected after you create them.
  - GH-93: When copying an instance, you can tell MultiMC to not copy the worlds.

- Mod and resource pack lists
  - GH-1237: Mod info is now clickable and selectable.
  - GH-1322: Mod description `...` link will no longer pop up multiple dialogs.
  - GH-1178: When dragged and dropped, folder based mods and resource packs will be copied properly on OSX.

- MCEdit integration:
  - GH-1009: MCEdit Unified on linux is now recognized properly.

- Mojang login and accounts:
  - GH-1158: A unique ID is generated on the MultiMC side before login, instead of letting the server decide.
  - When a password is required, the user login is partially obscured.
  - The dropdown menu on the main window now lists profiles, not accounts.

- Modpacks:
  - GH-1140: Modpack downloads now check for update on the server even if the file is already locally available.
  - GH-1148: When creating an instance from modpack, the instance name will be guessed based on the modpack file or URL (unless you set it yourself).
  - GH-1280: While importing modpacks, the progress dialog now says what is happening.
  - When selecting the modpack field in the new instance dialog, the contents are selected for easy replacement.

- Instance settings
  - Wrapper commands now use the proper UI field and do not get replaced with pre-launch commands.

- Minecraft launching:
  - GH-1053, GH-1338: Minecraft launching has been completely redone.
  - GH-1275: Server resource pack folder is created on launch.
    - This is a workaround for Minecraft bug MCL-3732.
  - GH-1320: Improve compatibility with non-Oracle Java.
  - GH-1355: MMC environment will no longer leak into Minecraft after MultiMC updates itself.

- Minecraft log:
  - Java exception detection in Minecraft logs has been improved.
  - GH-719: You can now use your own [paste.ee](https://paste.ee/) account for uploading logs.
    - New [paste.ee](https://paste.ee/) settings page has been added to the global settings dialog.
  - GH-1197: Text colors in log window now adapt to the background color.
  - GH-1164: The censor filter could be initialized with empty values, leading to unreadable log.
  - GH-1008, GH-1046, GH-1067: Log size limiting.

    The log window now has a configurable limit for the number of lines remembered. You can also specify whether it stops logging or forgets on the fly once the limit is breached.

    This prevents the MultiMC log window from using too much memory on logging. The default limit is 100000 lines and the logging stops.

    Minecraft logging this much is a sign of a problem that needs to be fixed. Any complaints should be addressed to the responsible mod authors.

- Screenshot upload
  - GH-1339: While uploading screenshots, the console window will not close (prevents a crash).

- Other logs:
  - GH-926: 'Other Logs' now has a button for removing all log files.
  - Hidden log files are shown in 'Other logs'.

- User skins:
  - MultiMC now uses [crafatar.com](https://crafatar.com/) for skin downloads instead of the Mojang servers.

- Java:
  - GH-1365: MultiMC now supports Java 9 and its new version numbering.
  - GH-1262: Java can now be placed in a folder relative to MultiMC's folder. This allows bundling of JREs with MultiMC.

- Translations:
  - GH-1313: Some parts of the MultiMC user interface have been marked as 'not for translation'.

### Internals and internal bug fixes

- GH-1052: All the dependencies were rebuilt and the build environment upgraded to the latest compiler versions.
- GH-1051: The CDPATH environment variable is now ignored.
- GH-77, GH-1059, GH-1060: The MultiMC updater is no longer used or necessary.

  It is only present to preserve compatibility with previous versions.
  Updates now work properly on Windows systems when you have Unicode (like ❄, Ǣ or Ω) characters in the path.

- GH-1069, GH-1100: `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and `LD_PRELOAD` environment variables supplied to MultiMC now don't affect MultiMC but affect the launched game.

  This means you can use something like the Steam overlay in MultiMC instances on Linux.
  If you need to use these variables for MultiMC itself, you can use `MMC_LIBRARY_PATH` and `MMC_PRELOAD` instead.

- GH-1389: External processes (like folder views, editors, etc.) are now started in a way that prevents the MultiMC environment to be reused by them.
- GH-1355: If `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` contains any of MultiMC's internal folders, this will not propagate to started processes.
- GH-1231, GH-1378: libpng is now included with the Linux version of MultiMC
- GH-1202: SSL certificates are now rebuilt on start on OSX.

- GH-1303: Translations and notification cache are stored in the normal data folder now, not alongside the binaries. This only affects third party Linux packaging.
- GH-1266, GH-1301: Linux runner scripts has been improved.
- GH-1360: Development and other unstable versions of MultiMC now uses GitHub commits instead of this manually maintained changelog.

## MultiMC 0.4.7

This is what 0.4.6 should have been. Oh well, at least it's here now!

### Functional changes
- GH-974: A copy of the libstdc++ library is now included in Linux releases, improving compatibility
- GH-985: Jar mods are now movable and removable after adding
- GH-983: Use `minecraft.jar` as the main jar when using jar mods - fixes NEI in Legacy Minecraft versions
- GH-977: Fix FTB paths on Windows

   This removes some very old compatibility code. If you get any issues, make sure you run the FTB Launcher and let it update its files.
- GH-992 and GH-1003: Improved performance when saving settings:
  - Bad performance was caused by improved data consistency
  - Each config file is now saved only once, not once for every setting
  - When loading FTB instances, there are no writes to config files anymore
- GH-991: Implemented wrapper command functionality:

  There is an extra field in the MultiMC Java settings that allows running Java inside a wrapper program or script. This means you can run Minecraft with wrappers like `optirun` and get better performance with hybrid graphics on Linux without workarounds.
- GH-997: Fixed saving of multi-line settings. This fixes notes.
- GH-967: It is now possible to add patches (Forge and LiteLoader) to tracked FTB instances properly.

  Libraries added by the patches will be taken from MultiMC's `libraries` folder, while the tracked patches will use FTB's folders.

- GH-1011 and GH-1015: Fixed various issues when the patch versions aren't complete

  This applies when Minecraft versions are missing or when patches are broken and the profile is manipulated by adding, moving, removing, customizing and reverting patches.

- GH-1021: Built in legacy Minecraft versions aren't customizable anymore

   The internal format for Legacy Minecraft versions does not translate to the external patch format and would cause crashes
- GH-1016: MultiMC prints a list of mods, core mods (contents of the core mods folder) and jar mods to the log on instance start. This should help with troubleshooting.
- GH-1031: Icons are exported and imported along with instances

    This only applies if the icon was custom (not built-in) when exporting and the user doesn't choose an icon while importing the pack.

### UI changes
- GH-970: Fixed help button for the External tools and Accounts dialog pages not linking to the proper wiki places
  - Same for the Versions dialog page

- GH-994: Rearranged the buttons on the Versions page to make jar mods less prominent

  Using the `Add jar mods` button will also show a nag dialog until it's been used successfully

## MultiMC 0.4.6

Long time coming, this release brought a lot of incremental improvements and fixes.

### Functional changes
- Old version.json and custom.json version files will be transformed into a Minecraft version patch:
  - The process is automated
  - LWJGL entries are stripped from the original file - you may have to re-do LWJGL version customizations
  - Old files will be renamed - .old extension is added
- It's now possible to:
  - Customize, edit and revert built in version patches (Minecraft, LWJGL)
  - Edit custom version patches (Forge, LiteLoader, other)
- Blocked various environment variables from affecting Minecraft:
  - `JAVA_ARGS`
  - `CLASSPATH`
  - `CONFIGPATH`
  - `JAVA_HOME`
  - `JRE_HOME`
  - `_JAVA_OPTIONS`
  - `JAVA_OPTIONS`
  - `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS`
  - If you rely on those in any way, now would be a time to fix that
- Improved handling of LWJGL on OSX (.dylib vs. .jnilib extensions)
- Jar mods are now always put into a generated temporary Minecraft jar instead of being put on the classpath
- PermGen settings:
  - Changed default PermGen value to 128M because of many issues from new users
  - MultiMC now recognizes the Java version used and will not add PermGen settings to Java >= 1.8
- Implemented simple modpack import and export feature:
  - Export allows selecting which files go into the resulting zip archive
  - Only MultiMC instances for now, other pack formats are planned
  - Import is either from local file or URL, URL can't have ad/click/pay gates
- Instance copy doesn't follow symlinks on Linux anymore
  - Still does on Windows because copying symlinks requires Administrator level access
- Instance delete doesn't follow symlinks anymore - anywhere
- MCEdit tool now recognizes MCEdit2.exe as a valid file to runtime
- Log uploads now follow the maximum allowed paste sizes of paste.ee and are encoded properly
- MultiMC now doesn't use a proxy by default
- Running profilers now works on Windows
- MultiMC will warn you if you run it from WinRAR or temporary folders
- Minecraft process ID is printed in the log on start
- SSL certificates are fixed on OSX 10.10.3 and newer - see [explanation](http://www.infoworld.com/article/2911209/mac-os-x/yosemite-10103-breaks-some-applications-and-https-sites.html).

### UI changes

  - Refresh when the icon theme does
- Changed default console font to Courier 10pt on Windows
- Description text in the main window status bar now updates when Minecraft version is changed
- Inserted blatant self-promotion (Only Minecraft 1.8 and up)
  - This adds a bit of unobtrusive flavor text to the Minecraft F3 screen
- Log page now has a button to scroll to bottom
- Errors are reported while updating the instance on the Version page
- Fixed typos (forge -> Forge)

### Internals
- Massive internal restructuring (ongoing)
- Downloads now follow redirects
- Minecraft window size is now always at least 1x1 pixel (prevents crash from bad settings)

- All download tasks now only start 6 downloads, using a queue (fixes issues with assets downloads)
- Fixed bugs related to corrupted settings files (settings and patch order file saves are now atomic)
- Updated zip manipulation library - files inside newly written zip/jar files should have proper access rights and timestamps
- Made Minecraft resource downloads more resilient (throwing away invalid/broken index files)
- Minecraft asset import from old format has been removed
- Generally improved MultiMC logging:
