0.0:
    - Initial release.
0.1:
    - Reworked the version numbering system to support our [new Git workflow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).
    - Added a tray icon for the console window.
    - Fixed instances getting deselected after FTB instances are loaded (or whenever the model is reset).
    - Implemented proxy settings.
    - Fixed sorting of Java installations in the Java list.
    - Jar files are now distributed separately, rather than being extracted from the binary at runtime.
    - Added additional information to the about dialog.
0.1.1:
    - Hotfix - Changed the issue tracker URL to [GitHub issues](https://github.com/MultiMC/MultiMC5/issues).
0.2:
    - Java memory settings have MB added to the number to make the units obvious.
    - Complete rework of the launcher part. No more sensitive information in the process arguments.
    - Cached downloads now do not destroy files on failure.
    - Mojang service status is now on the MultiMC status bar.
    - Java checker is no longer needed/used on instance launch.
    - Support for private FTB packs.
    - Fixed instance ID issues related to copying FTB packs without changing the instance name.
    - Forge versions are better sorted (build numbers above 999 were sorted wrong).
    - Fixed crash related to the MultiMC update channel picker in offline mode.
    - Started using icon themes for the application icons, fixing many OSX graphical glitches.
    - Icon sources have been located, along with icon licenses.
    - Update to the German translation.
0.2.1:
    - Hotfix - move the native library extraction into the onesix launcher part.
0.3:
    - Improved instance view
    - Overhauled 1.6+ version loading
    - Added a patch system for instance modification
        - There is no longer a single custom.json file that overrides version.json
        - Instead there are now "patch" files in <instance>/patches/, one for each main tweaker (forge, liteloader etc.)
        - These patches are applied after version.json in a customisable order,
        - A list of these files is shown in the left most tab in the Edit Mods dialog, where a list of libraries was shown before.
        - custom.json can still be used for overriding everything.
    - Offline mode can be used even when online
    - Show an "empty" message in version selector dialogs
    - Fix FTB paths on windows
    - Tooling support
        - JProfiler
        - JVisualVM
        - MCEdit
    - Don't assume forge in FTB instances and allow other libraries (liteloader, mcpatcher, etc.) in FTB instances
    - Screenshot uploading/managing
    - Instance badges
    - Some pre/post command stuff (remove the timeout, variable substitution)
    - Fix logging when the system language is not en_US
    - Setting PermGen to 64 will now omit the java parameter because it is the default
    - Fix encoding of escape sequences (tabs and newlines) in config files

    - Fix copying of FTB instances (instance type is changed properly now)
    - Customizing FTB pack versions will remove the FTB pack patch file
