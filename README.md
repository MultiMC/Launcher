Launcher
=========

Launcher is a custom launcher for Minecraft that focuses on predictability, long term stability and simplicity.

### Building
If you want to build Launcher yourself, check [BUILD.md](BUILD.md) for build instructions.

### Code formatting
Just follow the existing formatting.

In general, in order of importance:
* Make sure your IDE is not messing up line endings or whitespace and avoid using linters.
* Prefer readability over dogma.
* Keep to the existing formatting.
* Indent with 4 space unless it's in a submodule.
* Keep lists (of arguments, parameters, initializers...) as lists, not paragraphs. It should either read from top to bottom, or left to right. Not both.

## Forking/Redistributing/Custom builds policy
We keep Launcher open source because we think it's important to be able to see the source code for a project like this, and we do so using the Apache license.

Apache covers reasonable use for the name - a mention of the project's origins in the About dialog and the license is acceptable. However, it should be abundantly clear that the project is a fork *without* implying that you have our blessing.
