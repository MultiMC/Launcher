=========

MultiMC is a custom launcher for Minecraft that allows you to easily manage multiple installations of Minecraft at once. It also allows you to easily install and remove mods by simply dragging and dropping.

## Building
Check [BUILD.md](BUILD.md) for build instructions.

## Contributing
The repository is currently managed by @peterix. If you'd like to contribute to the project please talk to us on IRC (Esper/#MultiMC) first! This helps us organise ideas and keep in contact with you, and we're unlikely to accept anything blindly.

We use [Clang Format](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) to format the project. We highly recommend setting it up so the project stays well formatted, but there are issues with it on Windows. If you have trouble setting it up, check [.clang-format](.clang-format) manually. We don't accept pull requests with poor formatting. If you have questions, talk to us on IRC (Esper/#MultiMC) _before_ submitting a pull request.

## Forking/Redistributing
We keep MultiMC open source because we think it's important to be able to see the source code for a project like this, and we do so using the Apache license.

Part of the reason for using the Apache license is we don't want people using the "MultiMC" name when redistributing the project. This means people must take the time to go through the source code and remove all references to "MultiMC", including but not limited to the project icon and the title of windows, (no *MultiMC-fork* in the title).

Apache covers reasonable use for the name - a mention of the project's origins in the About dialog and the license is acceptable. However, it should be abundantly clear that the project is a fork *without* implying that you have our blessing.
