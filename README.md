MultiMC 5
=========

MultiMC is a custom launcher for Minecraft that focuses on predictability, long term stability and simplicity.

## Development
If you want to contribute, talk to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/multimc) first.

While blindly submitting PRs is definitely possible, they're not necessarily going to get accepted.

We aren't looking for flashy features, but expanding upon the existing feature set without distruption or endangering future viability of the project is OK.

### Building
If you want to build MultiMC yourself, check [BUILD.md](BUILD.md) for build instructions.

### Code formatting
Just follow the existing formatting.

In general, in order of importance:
* Make sure your IDE is not messing up line endings or whitespace and avoid using linters.
* Prefer readability over dogma.
* Keep to the existing formatting.
* Indent with 4 space unless it's in a submodule.
* Keep lists (of arguments, parameters, initializers...) as lists, not paragraphs. It should either read from top to bottom, or left to right. Not both.


## Translations
Translations can be done [on crowdin](https://translate.multimc.org). Please avoid making direct pull requests to the translations repository.

## Java Issue
According to the official Minecraft 1.18 update. You will need jdk 17 to run it properly. If you are also playing some older versions at the same time. You might need to switch betweek jdk 17 and jre 8. To solve the issue. It is pretty easy! You can configure java versions in the instance settings so you don't need to switch around all the time
java 8 for anything older than 1.16, java 17 for anything newer

## Forking/Redistributing/Custom builds policy
We keep MultiMC open source because we think it's important to be able to see the source code for a project like this, and we do so using the Apache license.

Part of the reason for using the Apache license is that we don't want people using the "MultiMC" name when redistributing the project. This means people must take the time to go through the source code and remove all references to "MultiMC", including but not limited to the project icon and the title of windows, (no *MultiMC-fork* in the title).

Apache covers reasonable use for the name - a mention of the project's origins in the About dialog and the license is acceptable. However, it should be abundantly clear that the project is a fork *without* implying that you have our blessing.
